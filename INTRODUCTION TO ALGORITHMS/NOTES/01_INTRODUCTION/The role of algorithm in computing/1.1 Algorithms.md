An [algorithm]() is any well defined computational procedure that takes in some value, or set of values as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in finite amount of time!

It can also be defined as a tool for solving a well specified computational problem. 

As an example suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into [monotonically](monotonic) increasing order. we will solve it like a sorting problem.

The given input sequence (31,41,59,26,41,58), a correct algorithm will return output (26,31,41,41,58,59). Such an input sequence is called an instance of the sorting problem. In general, an instance of the problem consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement ) needed to compute a solution to the problem.
