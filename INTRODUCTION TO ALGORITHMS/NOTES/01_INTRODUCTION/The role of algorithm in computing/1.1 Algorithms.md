An [algorithm]() is any well defined computational procedure that takes in some value, or set of values as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output in finite amount of time!

It can also be defined as a tool for solving a well specified computational problem. 

As an example suppose that you need to sort a sequence of numbers into [monotonically](monotonic)
