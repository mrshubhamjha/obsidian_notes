<u>Time and Space Complexity</u>

problem ----> solution
many ways to solve the problem so it'll have many solutions

The algorithm that takes less time is the best algorithm

A: <u>**sum of n number**</u>


```
for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
sum = sum+1;
}
```

two computes take two diff times for compiling this
old comp ---> 1000 takes 2 sec
new comp ---> 1000 takes 1 sec

Time complexity != time taken
